    <h3 id="authors-note">Author's note</h3>

    <p>
      <mark>I do not want to encourage copyright
      infringement</mark>. Therefore, this article is for educational
      purposes only.  Do not misuse this information to do something

    <h3 id="preface">Preface</h3>

    <p>
      When I started writing this article, I knew very little about
      Symbian OS.  Therefore, it should be noted that this is also a
      continuous learning process for me.  While I consider the
      documentation of these findings and observations a way to learn
      more about the ARM assembly language and to gain a basic
      understanding of data analysis and the process of reverse
      engineering, I must apologise for any inaccuracies you may
      encounter.  I consider myself quite technically proficient, but
      nevertheless this subject is relatively unexplored and new to me.
    </p>

    <p>
      My goal is to make this document as understandable and accessible
      as possible.  I do not want to get too bogged down in the
      technical details of the N-Gage and Symbian OS, but I want to find
      out in a self-experiment whether I can reconstruct and apply the
      techniques developed by the warez groups back in the mid-2000s.
    </p>

    <p>
      This article will focus on the differences between a retail dump
      of a game and a cracked version of the same title which I both
      obtained from the <a href="https://archive.org/">Internet
      Archive</a>, in order to better understand the copy protection
      mechanisms, to ultimately adapt and apply the techniques developed
      by the crackers.
    </p>

    <h3 id="folder-comparison">Folder comparison: Spot the changes</h3>

    <p>
      Before I could analyse the changes, I had to identify them first.
    </p>

    <p>
      In order to compare the folders containing the files of the
      cracked and uncracked version to each other, I used
      WinMerge.<label for="sn-2" class="sidenote-toggle
      sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-2"
      class="sidenote-toggle"
      /><span class="sidenote"> <a href="https://winmerge.org/">WinMerge</a>
      is an Open Source differencing and merging tool for Windows.
      WinMerge can compare both folders and files, presenting
      differences in a visual text format that is easy to understand and
      handle.</span>
    </p>

    <p>
      For the purpose of this research, I worked on one of the more
      recent games that was previously cracked by a group
      called <i>PWNPDA</i> that did not disable the N-Gage Arena
      feature, thus making this crack limited to the essentials, with
      minimal impact and changes to the game files.  Perfect!
    </p>

    <p>
      <img class="centered" src="img/ng-folder-comparison.png" alt="Folder
      comparison" />
    </p>

    <p>
      As you can see, only a single file has been altered here.  While
      this is not the case with all N-Gage games, it gives me an
      opportunity to take a closer look and analyse the crack in detail.
    </p>

    <p>
      It is also worth mentioning that other games have a more complex
      copy protection mechanism such as the N-Gage SDK Extension for
      Enhanced Copy Protection (ECP), which was ultimately also
      defeated.
    </p>

    <p>
      The warez group <i>BiNPDA</i> for instance, created their very own
      proprietary cracking method to achieve this.  Most games released
      by them use a loader, developed for this particular reason, which
      patches the uncracked executable file, while also faking several
      hardware conditions such as MMC size, MMC ID, etc.
    </p>

    <p>
      But the copy protection scheme I document here was the most
      commonly used until the end of the N-Gage era.
    </p>

    <h3 id="file-header">The file header: Get an overview</h3>

    <p>
      Before I could start analysing the data, it was only logical to
      get an overview of how the executable file is organised.  To
      achieve this, I opened the executable file using
      E32Explorer<label for="sn-3" class="sidenote-toggle
      sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-3"
      class="sidenote-toggle"
      /><span class="sidenote"><a href="https://github.com/mrRosset/E32Explorer">E32Explorer</a>
      is a simple tool to visualize the different parts of an Symbian OS
      E32Image and of a TRomImage.</span> and looked at the header:
    </p>

    <p>
      <img class="centered" src="img/ng-file-header.png" alt="File header" />
    </p>

    <p>
      While most of this information was irrelevant to me and I could
      ignore it, I was very interested in the code and import sections.
    </p>

    <p>
      I could also ignore the data section since it contains initialised
      data.  Moreover, most Symbian OS applications are found
      as <code>.app</code> or <code>.dll</code> files, so this section
      is usually inexistent in the first place.
    </p>

    <p>
      Furthermore, it is useful to calculate the size of the individual
      sections, but more on that later on.
    </p>

    <p id="dll_count">
      I also noted the value of <code>dll_count</code>, because I knew I
      might need it later.

      <ul>
        <li>
          <i>Code section</i>, contains three parts: text section,
          export address table and import address table.  The text
          section contains all the object files (<code>.obj</code>) of
          all your source code.  The export address table lists all the
          exported functions you have in your program.  The import
          address table lists all the imported functions used in your
          program.
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>BSS section</i>, contains un-initialized data. This section
          is usually not available in most Symbian OS applications.
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>Data section</i>, contains initialized data. Since most
          Symbian OS applications are found as <code>.app</code>
          or <code>.dll</code> files, this section usually does not
          exist either.
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>Import section</i>, contains the information about all
          imported functions used by the program.
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>Relocation section</i>, contains the relocation table
          needed by Symbian OS loader to load the program.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <h3 id="data-comparison">Data comparison: Pinpoint the changes</h3>

    <p>
      To get an overview of the modifications made, still without
      understanding exactly what they did, I opened HxD<label for="sn-5"
      class="sidenote-toggle
      sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-5"
      class="sidenote-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">HxD is a
      carefully designed and fast hex editor which, additionally to raw
      disk editing and modifying of main memory (RAM), handles files of
      any size.</span> and pressed <code>Ctrl+k</code> to start a hex
      comparison of the cracked and uncracked executable:
    </p>

    <p>
      <img class="centered" src="img/ng-app-comparison.png" alt="App comparison" />
    </p>

    <p>
      Now I needed something to write, so that I could document the
      modifications made and the corresponding file offsets.  The
      following information is important: the original hex value, the
      modified hex value and the offset for each consecutive data set.
      The offset is displayed as a hexadecimal value in the lower left
      corner of HxD.  I was also able to assign the file offsets to a
      corresponding section, as I know exactly where each section
      begins:

    <p>
      I did not need to make a note of the last dataset, as I could see
      the reason for the change in the section <code>Decoded
      text</code>:
    </p>

    <p>
      <img class="centered" src="img/ng-vanities.png" alt="Vanities" />
    </p>

    <p>
      The name of the <code>DLL</code> to be loaded was simply
      overwritten with vanities and in this curious case they did not
      even use their own signature.  The crackers merely copied this
      part from another group.
    </p>

    <h3 id="data-analysis"> Data analysis: Understand the changes</h3>

    <p>
      Next, comes the most interesting part.  I analysed the actual data
      at the file offsets I have noted down using IDA Pro. When I opened
      the file in IDA for the first time, it was important that I
      selected the correct processor type, and architecture, so that the
      program could disassemble the file correctly:
    </p>

    <p>
      <img class="centered" src="img/ng-ida-pro-load-file.png" alt="Load
      file in IDA Pro" />
    </p>

    <p>
      After loading the file into IDA, I selected the <code>Hex
      view</code> and navigated to the first noted file offset.  The
      offset is there, in the lower left corner, together with a
      reference that points to the disassembled code:
    </p>

    <p>
      <img class="centered" src="img/ng-ida-pro-nokiafc.png" alt="NokiaFC" />
    </p>

    <p>
      To have a closer look at this part of the program in detail, I
      switched back to the disassembly view (<code>IDA View</code>).  I
      also activated <code>Auto comments</code> under <code>Options →
      General</code>.  This is a very helpful setting to get a rough
      idea of what the code does, even if one is not familiar with the
      ARM assembly language.
    </p>

    <p>
      <img class="centered" src="img/ng-ida-pro-nokiafc-disasm.png"
      alt="NokiaFC disassembly" />
    </p>

    <p>
      So, what exactly is happening here? Let's summarise:
    </p>

    <p>
      As I already knew, this section is in the <code>.text</code> or
      code section.  So, the section of the program's virtual address
      space that contains executable instructions.  Let's go through the
      code line by line:
    </p>

    <p>
      <code>LDR R12, = __imp_NOKIAFC_1 (04 C0 9F E5)</code>
    <p>

    <p>
      Basically, <code>LDR</code> is used to load something from memory
      into a register.  As the prefix <code>__imp_</code> suggests,
      an imported function is loaded at this point.  To understand the
      purpose of this function, I would have to analyse it separately;
      it is located in the file <code>nokiafc.dll</code> and is part of
      the device firmware.  This would go beyond the scope of this
      article.  In a nutshell: the instruction gets the address of an
      imported function.
    </p>

    <p>
      Then, it loads the value located at the specified memory address
      and stores it in a register:
    </p>

    <p>
      <code>LDR R12, [R12] (00 C0 9C E5)</code>
    </p>

    <p>
      And last but not least, I jumped to the loaded function with the
      instruction <code>BX</code>:
    </p>

    <p>
      <code>BX R12 (1C FF 2F E1)</code>
    </p>

    <p>
      Now, let's take a closer look at what the crackers have changed
      and what this means for the execution of this function:
    </p>

    <p>
      <code>BX LR (1E FF 2F E1)</code>
    </p>

    <p>
      Essentially, only the first instruction has been replaced, which
      means that the subsequent ones are no longer being executed.  I
      could, just as well, have overwritten them with
      0.  <code>LR</code> usually holds the return address.  It also
      means that this is a return from a function and signifies that
      this function will be left immediately.
    </p>

    <p>
      Tip: an easy way to find out which instruction is represented by a
      so-called immediate-value (<code>1E FF 2F E1</code>) is to use an
      online disassembler like ODA.<label for="sn-6"

      this value is actually encoded:
      <a href="https://alisdair.mcdiarmid.org/arm-immediate-value-encoding/">ARM
      immediate value encoding</a>
    </p>

    <p>
      And on we go.
    </p>

    <p>
      Here is the second change made within the code section:
    </p>

    <p>
      <img class="centered" src="img/ng-ida-pro-cone318.png"
      alt="CONE_318" />
    </p>

    <p>
      After switching to the disassembly view (by the way, it is
      advisable to always use the hex view first, otherwise you run the
      risk of mixing-up the virtual address location with the file
      offset):
    </p>

    <p>
      <img class="centered" src="img/ng-ida-pro-cone318.png"
      alt="CONE_318 disassembly" />
    </p>

    <p>
      Why does it look so different now?  The reason is that this is the
      import address table (IAT) within the code section.  The import
      address table lists all the imported functions used in the
      program.
    <p>

    <p>
      Note that in Symbian OS, all functions are imported by ordinal
      (not by function name).  The idea is to make the library file size
      smaller and that is exactly what I have found here: the ordinal
      number 318 as hex value in little-endian notation:
    </p>

    <p>
      <code>3E 01 → 13Eh → 318</code>
    </p>

    <p>
      This ordinal number is replaced by the number 214:
    </p>

    <p>
      <code>D6 00 → D6h → 214</code>
    </p>

    <p>
      At this stage, the reason for this change is not clear to me.
      Nevertheless, I have seen this in several cracked games while
      doing my research.  I do not wanna delve into this any deeper.
    </p>

    <p>
      Now I have come to the last modification where IDA could help me.
      Strictly speaking, these are two successive changes:
    </p>

    <p>
      <img class="centered"
      src="img/ng-cmda-audio-output-stream-pad-function.png"
      alt="CMdaAudioOutputStreamPadFunction" />
    </p>

    <p>
      Here the ordinal number of the
      function <code>CMdaAudioOutputStreamPadFunction(void)</code> is
      changed from 2 to 1:
    </p>

    <p>
      <code>02 00 00 00 → 01 00 00 00</code>
    </p>

    <p>
      At this point there are probably some system-specific
      characteristics.  From what I have been able to find out so far,
      the ordinal number 2 means that the function contacts
      the <i>shared data server</i>.  Again, I do not want to research
      the details.
    </p>

    <p>
      And now to the last part, which has to be modified within the code
      section:
    </p>

    <p>
      <img class="centered" src="img/ng-ida-pro-nokiafc-ordinal.png"
      alt="NokiaFC ordinal number" />
    </p>

    <p>
      Does this function look familiar?  Yes, of course.  But here, the
      ordinal number is set from 1 to 0, which simply means
      non-existent:
    </p>

    <p>
      <code>01 00 00 00 → 00 00 00 00</code>
    </p>

    <h3 id="import-table">The import table: Put things in order</h3>

    <p>
      Last but not least, I reviewed the import section.  For this, I
      opened the file with the hex-editor and scrolled down to the file
      offset in the import section as specified in the
      <a href="#file-header">file header</a> (<code>1B419Ch</code>).
      Here is a brief summary of how it is structured:
    </p>

    <p>
      <img class="centered"
           src="img/ng-ida-pro-import-section-header.png" alt="Import
           section header" />
    </p>

    <p>
      The first Dword (4 Byte) of the import section contains the total
      size of the section.  In this case:
    </p>

    <p>
      <code>7C 08 00 00 → 87Ch → 2172</code>
    </p>

    <p>
      This is followed by import blocks for each imported DLL and how
      many DLLs are imported in total.  I have learned earlier from the
      header (<code><a href="#dll_count">dll_count</a></code>), in this
      case, a total of 16.
    </p>

    <p>
      Each block begins with 2 Dwords. These are the file offset to the
      <code>DLL</code> filename and the number of imported functions.
      Please note that the offset is always specified relative to the
      import section and not relative to the beginning of the file.
      This is followed by a list of the ordinal numbers of the imported
      functions, before the next block begins.
    </p>

    <p>
      To make this more clear, this is the first block in detail:
    </p>

    <p>
      <img class="centered"
           src="img/ng-ida-pro-import-section-example.png" alt="Import
           section example" />
    </p>

    <p>
      As I now knew, this is the file offset to the <code>DLL</code>
      filename relative to the import section:
    </p>

    <p>
      <code>90 06 00 00 → 690h + 1B419Ch = 1B482C</code>
    </p>

    <p>
      After I jumped to this file offset, I quickly recognised the file
      name of the <code>DLL</code> from which the functions are
      imported:
    </p>

    <p>
      <img class="centered"
           src="img/ng-ida-pro-import-section-dll-name.png" alt="Import
           section DLL name" />
    </p>

    <p>
      Next, I immediately saw that a total of 4 functions are imported
      from this file:
    </p>

    <p>
      <img class="centered"
           src="img/ng-ida-pro-import-section-entry-size.png"
           alt="Import section entry size" />
    </p>

    <p>
      This means that the following 4 Dwords contain the ordinal numbers
      of these functions:
    </p>

    <p>
      <img class="centered"
           src="img/ng-ida-pro-import-section-entry-ordinals.png"
           alt="Import section entry ordinals" />
    </p>

    <p>
      <code>03 00 00 00 → 03h → 3</code><br />
      <code>06 00 00 00 → 06h → 6</code><br />
      <code>1B 00 00 00 → 1Bh → 27</code><br />
      <code>47 00 00 00 → 47h → 71</code>
    </p>

    <p>
      That's about it.  Simple, right?  I continued this until I reached
      file offset <code>1B47C0h</code> to get an idea of what has been
      modified there.
    </p>

    <br />

    <div>
      <table>
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <th><code>Uncracked</code></th>
            <th scope="row" style="background: LightPink;"><code>02 00 00 00 28 08 00 00 01 00 00 00 01 00 00 00</code></th>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <th><code>Cracked</code></th>
            <th scope="row" style="background: Aquamarine;"><code>01 00 00 00 3E 08 00 00 01 00 00 00 00 00 00 00</code></th>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <th><code>Offset</code></th>
            <th><code>1B47C0h</code>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <th><code>Section</code></th>
            <th><code>Code</code></th>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>
    </div>

    <p>
      After taking a closer look at the previously noted alterations,
      there is one number that stood out in particular:
    </p>

    <p><code>28 08 00 00 → 828h</code></p>

    <p>
      I could verify this assumption by adding the import offset and
      looking at the corresponding position in a hex editor:
    </p>

    <p>
      <code>828h + 1B419Ch = 1B49C4h</code>
    </p>

    <p>
      <img class="centered"
           src="img/ng-ida-pro-import-section-nokiafc-offset.png"
           alt="Import section NokiaFC offset" />
    </p>

    <p>
      As I could see, the file offset which refers to the file name
      NOKIAFC.DLL had been altered.  Let's see where it points to now:
    </p>

    <p>
      <code>83Eh + 1B419Ch = 1B49DAh</code>
    </p>

    <p>
      Apparently, only the next valid <code>DLL</code> was referenced.
      I think such an entry must merely not be invalid.
    </p>

    <p>
      <img class="centered"
           src="img/ng-ida-pro-import-section-nokiafc-new-offset.png"
           alt="Import section NokiaFC new offset" />
    </p>

    <p>
      The two following Dwords only indicate that only one function is
      imported here. However, the ordinal number 1 is to be replaced by
      0, i.e. non-existent.
    </p>

    <p>
      So, the last small change can only be an ordinal number and I
      could see from which file this change is made, if I simply
      navigated back to the previous <code>DLL</code> file name offset
      and checked what is behind it:
    </p>

    <p>
      <img class="centered"
           src="img/ng-ida-pro-import-section-mcas-offset.png"
           alt="Import section MediaClientAudioStream offset" />
    </p>

    <p>
      <code>03 08 → 803h + 1B419Ch = 1B499Fh</code>
    </p>

    <p>
      <img class="centered"
           src="img/ng-ida-pro-import-section-mcas-dll-name.png"
           alt="Import section MediaClientAudioStream DLL name" />
    </p>

    <p>
      This change is not at all surprising, since I already adjusted the
      ordinal number of this function in the import address table
      accordingly.  Now I also corrected it in the import section.
    </p>

    <h3 id="resume-preface">Résumé</h3>

    <p>That's about it.</p>

    <p>
      Even though I did not manage to figure out every little detail of
      the copy protection mechanisms, and frankly, this was never my
      goal, I put my acquired findings to the test and tried to get a
      copy of a previously unreleased game to work on my regular N-Gage.
    </p>

    <p>
      This copy had been circulating on the net for quite some time,
      after it was bought at an auction on eBay and made available on
      the internet by the buyer shortly after.  Unfortunately, this copy
      only ran on a special developer unit that was sold with the
      game.
    </p>

    <p>
      After applying the proper adjustments, the game launched without
      any problems and I was able to experience a piece of lost video
      game history first hand.<br />
      I also learned a lot about ARM assembly language and the basic
      process of reverse engineering.
    </p>

    <p>
      An exciting and definitely educational experience.
    </p>
